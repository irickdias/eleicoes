# eleicoes

College's project using Java and Spring Framework for the backend, and HTML/CSS and JavaScript for the frontend. It simulates a election management website,
from administrator's view, where you can do basic CRUD for candidates, election types (presidents, senators, etc) and politicals parties. Also, there's a page where you can
add new candidates to a certain election type, and another one to see the statistics from a election. The statistics's page uses a graphic from the Chats.js framework.
